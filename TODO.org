* SCINUMTOOLS TODO

** High priority
- create std::variant for the unit exponents
- create sphix documentation
- start writing doxygen documentation comments and docstring
  
** Low priority
- currently there are no uncertaintes in dip values, only in units/Quantities. In the future this should also be possible for values in general.
- improve error handling strategy in whole snt
- installation using homebrew
- implement dip linter
- installation as a debian package
- implement materials
- substitute includes in header by forward declarations
- implement variable precision in int/float
- consolide string format and add gtests

* v0.3a
- change node list in puq environment to NodeValue instead of NodeBase, so that value can be printed out using to_string()
- include pybind11 to dip and puq
- remove QuantityNode and move its functionality to the ValueNode
- removed PUQ array and MAGNITUDE_ARRAYS
- transformed DIP Environment BaseNode list into a ValueNode list

* v0.2a
- add template solver to dip
- rename "float" to "real"
- change puq magnitude array format to the snt::array_to_string
- implement arrays into puq magnitude to_string()
- switch [] and {} symbols in puq unit notation
- extract nostd function from puq to a global namespace so that also other modules can contribute
- remove array completely from puq
- split .h files with multiple classes
- move array namespace to snt
